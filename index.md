## A Little Bit About Me...
![Peony Lum Picture](Images/Peony.JPG) <br />
I am currently a third year student at UCSD, majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Design. I am most interested in UI/UX Design and Frontend 
Development, though I really want to learn about all types of cutting-edge technology. On my free time, I enjoy drawing, painting, and art in general.

**Disclaimer: Though I believe these 3 images capture the essence of who I am, I do actually have much more to me than the 3 images above!**

## Why Computer Science?
When I was a Senior in High School, I took AP Computer Science, and while I was not great at programming then, I was intrigued by the concept of programming and creating software. I was incredibly hesitant to choose to major in Computer Science, and instead almost majored in Biology. Yet, the excitement I would get when seeing my code compile and run successfully was too much to ignore. Therefore, I am now a *Computer Scientist in Training*. 

## My Favorite Courses I Have Taken at UCSD
1. CSE 8B <br/>
*Though this course was challenging, I truly experienced what coding was*
2. DSGN 1 <br/>
*This course inspired me to minor in design, it made me feel passionate about wanting to design UI/UX*
3. COGS 187A <br/>
*I learned all about wireframing and prototyping in this course, true wonders!*
