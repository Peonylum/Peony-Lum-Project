## A Little Bit About Me...
I am currently a third year student at UCSD, majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Design. I am most interested in UI/UX Design and Frontend 
Development, though I really want to learn about all types of cutting-edge technology. On my free time, I enjoy drawing, painting, and art in general.
