## :sparkles: A Little Bit About Me... :sparkles:
![Peony Lum Picture](Images/Peony.JPG) <br />
I am currently a third year student at UCSD, majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Design. I am most interested in UI/UX Design and Frontend 
Development, though I really want to learn about all types of cutting-edge technology. On my free time, I enjoy drawing, painting, and art in general.

### Fun Facts 
- My favorite programming language is **Java** :coffee:
- My hometown is **San Francisco** :bridge_at_night:
- A quote I live by: 
> I am ready to face any challenge that is foolish enough to face me - Dwight Schrute (The Office)
- A piece of code I live by:
```
while(noSuccess) {
  tryAgain();
  if(Dead) {
    break;
  }
}
```

## :computer: Why Computer Science? :computer:
When I was a Senior in High School, I took AP Computer Science, and while I was not great at programming then, I was intrigued by the concept of programming and creating software. I was incredibly hesitant to choose to major in Computer Science, and instead almost majored in Biology. Yet, the excitement I would get when seeing my code compile and run successfully was too much to ignore. I am now ~~dreaming of the day that I can call myself a Computer Scientist~~ a ***Computer Scientist in training***.
